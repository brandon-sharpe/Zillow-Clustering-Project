<!-- Describe your project in brief -->
The Zestimate is a powerful tool used by zillow to predict the final sale price of realestate. My goal for this project is to identify whats driving error between the Zestimate and the final sale prices. To accomplish this goal I will be utilizing clustering and regression models. I will present my findings via a notebook walkthrough to my datascience team.

This is a place holder for when I have key takeaways and fingings
I will also be placing the graphic that best represents my findings at the placeholder gif below.
